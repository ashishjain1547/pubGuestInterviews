Even exceptionally successful people are not immune to
tough times, for ex. Steve Jobs was thrown out of the company he founded, Bill Gates was deposed
in the Microsoft v. US antitrust lawsuit in which the judgement was that Microsoft would be
broken into two separate companies. Elon Musk was removed as chairman of the company he founded
and barred from holding this position for any company for three years after he posted a tweet
that was misleading to the investors. Please share any such experience of yours with us.
