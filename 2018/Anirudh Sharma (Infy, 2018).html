                Anirudh 5 years from now will be physically fit and active. Professionally, he'll be more devoted to his career and his growth will be better than the present career graph. He would have learnt some new languages by then, at least Urdu. He will be more devoted to his family. And I hope the kid inside will still be there. That's a lot to ask from future Anirudh, but the present Anirudh feels he is capable enough.
