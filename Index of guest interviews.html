<pre>Even exceptionally successful people are not immune to tough times, for ex. Steve Jobs was thrown out of the company he founded, Bill Gates was deposed in the Microsoft v. US antitrust lawsuit in which the judgement was that Microsoft would be broken into two separate companies. Elon Musk was removed as chairman of the company he founded and barred from holding this position for any company for three years after he posted a tweet that was misleading to the investors.

<p><strong>If you have a story to share, please write to us at "ashishjainblogger@gmail.com".</strong></p>

Steve Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO John Sculley. In 1983, Jobs had lured John Sculley away from Pepsi-Cola to serve as Apple's CEO, asking, "Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?"

Bill Gates was deposed in the "United States v. Microsoft Corp." antitrust law case in which Microsoft Corporation was accused of holding a monopoly and engaging in anti-competitive practices contrary to sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. This resulted in breaking down of the Microsoft into smaller companies (one making operating systems and another for software solutions like web browser). (Date decided: 28 June 2001)

Elon Musk had to step down as chairman of Tesla, his electric car making company, and pay a $20 million fine to settle charges brought against him by the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to CNN. SEC said they were suing Musk for misleading investors, an allegation stemming from a controversial tweet he sent out in August. Musk had sent out an early morning tweet on August 7 (2018) declaring he was taking Tesla private at $420 a share. “Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured,” Musk tweeted, short and simple.
