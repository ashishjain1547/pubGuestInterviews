                Define 'hard work'.

            <p class="customAnswer">
                Hard worker is one who puts in more than expected effort to make sure no stone remains unturned for
                achieving something. Ultimate result can be failure or success but effort that goes in for this task is
                best that which this person could have done in his capacity with limited resources available. Someone
                rightly said, "Tides can change shape of stones if consistency is maintained". Hard workers are someone
                having similar characteristics where they continuously try to perform best under extreme circumstances
                to gain best out of the provided situation.

                Tasks are always new for me most of the times. Am not afraid of new activities or tasks. Older,
