                I want to express my experiences from my restaurant. <br>
                Let us say there is a customer A and customer B. <br>
                Customer A makes the following requests: <br>
                1. Soup be made thicker. <br>
                2. Food be served after a time duration or gap after soup. <br>
                3. Like playing a song on repeat. <br>

                Every customer teaches me something new. <br>

                I cannot yell at a customer, who yelling at me. Restaurant is a professional place for me. I cannot make it a place for screaming match. <br>
                I have to maintain my behavior and voice/tome that is pleasing. <br>

                Behavior of customer A might be irritating to the customer B but at the end bothe are my customers. <br>
                I handle customer A to the best treatment possible when alone and accordingly when in presence of other customers. <br>

                Some customers who come lack patience. <br>
                1. Customer wants fresh food. <br>

                2. They also want it immediately. <br>
                Now these are opposite to each other.
