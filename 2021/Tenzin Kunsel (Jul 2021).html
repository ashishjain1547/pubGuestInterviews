<!-- Tenzin Kunsel was born in India but his mother is from Tibet. Kunsel has not been given any Indian document as a proof of identity. He says "There are ways to obtain them by paying huge sums of money". 

A7: One year back, when I was in Delhi (Jun 2020) that time I was smoking wee, Hash (the cigar, black one) and that too regularly so it make me feel that I wasted a lot of precious time.

A10: There was a Tibetan girl I had been involved with one year back. At this point of time, she had moved to US to work there. We had gone to the same school and she one day last year texted me that she had a crush on me. Now this one year back, she was sending me money from US but I later on refused to take more money from her as it was not right.
