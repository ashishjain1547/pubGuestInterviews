Gurarchi Kaur's feedback (as in Dec 2019):

1. This project is giving you the perceptions of that person according to the time that she or he is going through.

2. The answers from the people may not be credible.

3. You are not having a holistic view of that person's environment, behaviors or interactions or dealings. You are focused on an aspect.
