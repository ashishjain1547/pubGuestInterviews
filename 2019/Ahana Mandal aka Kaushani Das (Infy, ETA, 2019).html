                What would be your message to anyone aspiring success?
            </strong>
            <p class="customAnswer">
                By “success”, most people mean “good job, car, house, etc etc” - basically, being a star kid... I am not
                a star kid. I haven’t achieved that kind of success... so I have no message for others. <br />
                I could say that “follow your passion”. Of course, if you do that, eventually, you’ll be satisfied with
                yourself, and feel successful. But I have seen people who follow the herd, get good jobs etc, make their
                parents proud, and feel good about themselves too (as in, no regrets). <br />
                So, I guess, it depends on what definition of “success” holds true for you.

                What is the biggest mistake that you have ever made?
            </strong>
            <p class="customAnswer">
                I have done a lot of things I wish I hadn’t done. But I can’t call them mistakes. They were choices that
                defined the path of my life.

            <p class="customAnswer">
                I don’t know what to say about this one either... I don’t think if I drew a timeline for my life, I
                could draw lines
                clearly separating tough times from good times...

                What is the one thing that motivates you the most?
            </strong>
            <p class="customAnswer">
                I don’t know what motivates me... but I can talk about what keeps me going — it is “hope”... I guess I
                am never short of it. Good for me! <br />
                In career, I keep hoping that somebody I’ll be really great at what I do. So, I haven’t given up. <br />
                When it comes to life in general — no matter how tough the times are, I always feel that my situation is
                not so bad (I have seen people with worse luck). Also, I feel that the bad times are what makes my life
                so interesting. And I know, everything will pass. I know there’ll be good times in future, and I look
                forward to them. <br />
                Plus, I love things like leaves, trees, birds, sky, clouds, starts, etc etc. As long as I can see them
                and appreciate the beauty, I’m good.

            <p class="customAnswer">
                Not just one thing... lot of things worry me or have worried me in the past... worry about my parents’ health, worry about my sister, worry about losing my love... then, worry about earth - might sound cheesy or cliche, but it’s true... it does disturb me (significantly) when I see utter disrespect for the earth — the nature, fellow species, fellow humans... when I was a kid, I worried about getting caught or something like that... <br/>
                And in each of these case, I have felt it just as strongly.... <br/>
                So how can I possibly give you just one answer?

                I have never lived my life according to any plan. And 5 years is too long a time for me. Can’t imagine myself making a plan for such a long period!
