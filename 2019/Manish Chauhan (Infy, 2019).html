            <strong class="customQuestion" data-qno="1">What is the one factor that contributed most in what you
                have achieved in life?</strong>
            <p class="customAnswer">This factor basically depends on situation. When I was doing my BTech, my
                father was farmer. He was earning money, but in a hard way. When I did my BTech, I wanted to go for
                civil services. But that area requires time and money. Perfect guidance is also required. Later, I
                dropped out of MTech and did CDAC with rank 44. My way of thinking changed. I was not satisfied
                with CDAC. I was not able to apply to a lot of jobs due to my low high school results. Then, I met
                a guy in my first job, he told me that you are free my side for 3 months, and if I don't get my
                desired job, you will continue to do your current job. Three months down the line I got a job at
                Samsung.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong class="customQuestion" data-qno="2">What is your single biggest achievement?</strong>
            <p class="customAnswer">I am continuing at my present job, even when I am not willing to do any job.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong class="customQuestion" data-qno="3">What is the one lesson that you learnt the hard way?</strong>
            <p class="customAnswer">To hide some things from our official circle. Keep secrets secret.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong class="customQuestion" data-qno="4">What is the one thing that you would like to change about
                India to make it a better country?</strong>
            <p class="customAnswer">The thing is from salary perspective, minimum wages standard should be
                there. There should not be wide gaps in salaries of employees.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong class="customQuestion" data-qno="5">What would be your message to anyone aspiring success?</strong>
            <p class="customAnswer">Whatever work is given to you, do that but don't stop yourself from your
                interest area.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong class="customQuestion" data-qno="6">What is the biggest mistake that you have ever made?</strong>
            <p class="customAnswer">I wasn't calm, did not hide my secrets.
                Biggest mistake was that I chose to do that what I am doing in job.
                I am keen to go home. I don't want to spend much time in office.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong class="customQuestion" data-qno="7">Please tell us about the toughest times you have ever had,
                the most testing times that you have been through.</strong>
            <p class="customAnswer">
                Toughest time was when I changed my job, at the time of appraisal, director at my then current
                company told me that either you resign or we will fire you. I asked them why, they told me that
                business is not going good. Employees who came early will be asked to leave as well but you came
                late so you have to go first.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong class="customQuestion" data-qno="8">What is the one thing that motivates you the most?</strong>
            <p class="customAnswer">When I look at other guys, who are working harder than me. Surround yourself
                with hard working people.</p>
