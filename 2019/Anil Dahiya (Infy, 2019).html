            <strong class="customQuestion" data-qno="1">What is the one factor that contributed most in what you
                have achieved in life?</strong>
            <p class="customAnswer">Thanks to all the hardships of life which have helped me in growing and becoming what I am today both personally and professionally.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong class="customQuestion" data-qno="2">What is your single biggest achievement?</strong>
            <p class="customAnswer">Able to listen to myself and do what my heart says irrespective of the situation. Feel other peoples pain and realizing it to be more than silly pains of life we have. Not to get moved away by anything be it materialistic or anything. I will say achieving and understanding all this is the biggest achievement for my life so far.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong class="customQuestion" data-qno="3">What is the one lesson that you learnt the hard way?</strong>
            <p class="customAnswer">Never expect from someone because that is root cause of all sufferings. Each individual is different in all terms, have different mind set and they act accordingly. Better to keep doing what you love to do and never expect anything in return.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong class="customQuestion" data-qno="4">What is the one thing that you would like to change about
                India to make it a better country?</strong>
            <p class="customAnswer">Forming political parties by getting votes by: making people emotional or raising religion topics or boundaries of countries or finding just mistakes in other parties without highlighting own party achievements. I would like youth to come forward and make near ones understand their rights of votes and issue factors surrounding them. High time for people to come above reservation support, we are living in a free country and each individual have equal rights then why still reservation? Look around in other developed countries, do they follow any such thing. I think if some of these issues are worked upon then India will be a much better place and we will have better leaders / professionals and more sensible decisions taking place for betterment of society.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong class="customQuestion" data-qno="5">What would be your message to anyone aspiring success?</strong>
            <p class="customAnswer">Keep working hard along with smart. Learn from mistakes and live life fully without getting moved from failures at any point of life be it: professionally / love life etc. Nothing here stays forever, it’s never late... tons of opportunities everywhere. Just a trigger in terms of self-confidence as well as never-giving-up attitude is all what is needed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong class="customQuestion" data-qno="6">What is the biggest mistake that you have ever made?</strong>
            <p class="customAnswer">Falling in love with someone who never understood me.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong class="customQuestion" data-qno="7">Please tell us about the toughest times you have ever had,
                the most testing times that you have been through.</strong>
            <p class="customAnswer">Toughest and testing time was when I went on-site and lived away from my most loved person on this Earth, each day was not lesser than a year. Each passing day was testing this love relationship which turned distance all of a sudden by shaking it up with new issues each day and daily fights.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong class="customQuestion" data-qno="8">What is the one thing that motivates you the most?</strong>
            <p class="customAnswer">Learning and exploring out new things, making near ones happy and making their life easier somehow motivates me the most... it's non-ending process. Each day is a new day, it’s we who tie it with previous day... each day deserves its part from us.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong class="customQuestion" data-qno="9">What is the one thing that worries you the most?</strong>
            <p class="customAnswer">When my near ones take a path by ignoring me along with my warnings of consequences that happen by taking that path. I get worried because that person on whom I spent time was something worth to me and seeing him or her in pain will only hurt me.
