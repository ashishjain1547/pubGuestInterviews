                There was a boy who used to ask his mother "where is my mama? Do I have a mama? Everyone's mama comes to visit him, but not mine." <br>
                Then the mother said "go to that farm, your mama is there." Boy went there and scouted but he could not find his mama. So he came back. Then his mother gave a handful of mustard seeds and said "spill it across farmland and your mama will come". When the boy went back to the farm and spilled the mustard seeds, this produced a very good crop of mustard. Next day his mama came and asked "I have heard that you have got a very good crop of mustard?"
