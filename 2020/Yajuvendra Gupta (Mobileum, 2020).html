         <p class="customAnswer">
            Wrong decisions at different times. Never decided a goal to achieve in life (only professional side). I
            always did work that I got as per my personal situation and circumstances by keeping my family on priority
            rather than my career. Most important thing to me is affection of my children.

         <p class="customAnswer">
            May 2013 to April 2015, two years when I had no job, not earning even a single Rupee. I had tried all
            options to get a job in education (teaching) or IT setor at each level.
            <br />
            And last year when again I had no job during August 2018 to September 2019 (more than a year) and suffering
            from hyper-tension and depression problems for which I am on treatment to recover till today.

            Faith in god. My children. And people and their families with kids who have nothing to loose in their life
            as they are fighting for basic needs for their survival. The food, the clothes, shelter, etc.

            Please tell us about your five-year plan, personally and professionally.
         </strong>
         <p class="customAnswer">
            I don't believe in any five-years professional plan. I only believe in making present day good in all
            aspects (professionally and personally), as tomorrow may never come and it depends on today.
            <br />
            But personal point of view, I want to be mentally and physically healthy so that I can fulfil my
            responsibilities towards my family as my kids are very young. I want to live each and every moment of my
            life with small, small happiness with my family and children.
            <br />
            As future is very uncertain and we have got this life only for one time. I believe in living life and not
            passing it away with many tensions and fears.
