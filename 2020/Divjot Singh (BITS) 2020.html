            <strong class="customQuestion" data-qno="1">What is the one factor that contributed most in what you
                have achieved in life?</strong>
            <p class="customAnswer">
                I would say luck and projects (including winning some major competitions) I did in school and college which set me on the current career path. Also, my parents supported me even when they had to face tough times.

            <strong class="customQuestion" data-qno="2">What is your single biggest achievement?</strong>
            <p class="customAnswer">
                On a personal level helping parents to buy a house and professionally I am also doing well but there is room for improvement.

            <strong class="customQuestion" data-qno="3">What is the one lesson that you learnt the hard way?</strong>
            <p class="customAnswer">
                People change, I have changed. 5 years back I had different expectations from life and today I have different. In the next decade, it may change again. We as human beings are always changing and we would have to live with that. Your relationships with your partner, parents, siblings and friends would also change for good or bad. That does not mean we should get depressed or extremely happy. Because it is part of life and you cannot do anything about it. So accept it as part of life.

                India to make it a better country?</strong>
            <p class="customAnswer">
                We should invest in people and develop critical thinking in them. This can be done by increasing education standards.

            <p class="customAnswer">
                Not starting investments when I started my career. Now a decade later I regret on missing out the compounding returns.

            <p class="customAnswer">
                Well, about 18 years ago my dad lost his job and had to move outside to the city to work which brought all the responsibilities of the house upon me. It was tough until my graduation as money was tough until I was placed in a company.

                Technology evolution is the most exciting and motivating thing for me. In the next decade or two, we would have some major breakthroughs in health and space travel.

                Availability of Jobs in the next decade with AI taking up majority of the jobs which would cause civil unrest. Already we see the gap between rich and poor at historical levels.
